## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 5 phases following strict dependency chain (schema+engine -> webhooks -> delivery -> dashboard -> realtime)
- Research: Assignment engine must be a single Postgres function with advisory locks. No application-level rotation state.
- Research: Use Supavisor port 6543 from day one to prevent connection exhaustion on Vercel.
- Research: Pin zod to ~3.24.0 (v4 blocked by react-hook-form resolver issue).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GHL webhook payload schema is not formally documented and may change. Store raw jsonb alongside parsed fields. Validate with real test webhook during Phase 2.
